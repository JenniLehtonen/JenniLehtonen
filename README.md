### Hello there, I'm Jenni 👋
Welcome to my Github profile! Here you can find projects that I have done. Some of my own favourites are [Restaurant Quinto](https://github.com/JenniLehtonen/Restaurant-Quinto/), [Quiz project](https://github.com/JenniLehtonen/Quiz-project/), [Weather app](https://github.com/JenniLehtonen/Weather-app) and [Exercise diary](https://github.com/JenniLehtonen/Exercise-diary). My main focus on programming is web development.

I am currently working on a school project in which we create a mobile application for searching movies. The application is built with React Native.
